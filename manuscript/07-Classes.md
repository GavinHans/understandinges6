Ever since JavaScript was first created, many developers have been confused by its lack of classes. Most formal object-oriented programming languages support classes and classical inheritance as the primary way of defining similar and related objects. From pre-ECMAScript 1 all the way through ECMAScript 5, this point of confusion led many libraries to create utilities designed to make JavaScript look like it had support for classes.

While there are some JavaScript developers who feel strongly that the language doesn't need classes, the fact that so many libraries were created specifically for this purpose led to the inclusion of classes in ECMAScript 6. However, ECMAScript 6 classes aren't exactly the same as classes in other language. There's a uniqueness about them that embraces the dynamic of JavaScript as a language.

## Class-Like Structures in ECMAScript 5

Before exploring classes, it's helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms that classes use. In ECMAScript 5 and earlier, there were no classes, and the closest equivalent was creating a constructor and then assigning methods to its prototype. This approach is called creating a custom type. For example:

```js
function PersonType(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

PersonType.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name);
};

let person = new PersonType("Nicholas");
person.sayName();   // outputs "Nicholas"

console.log(person instanceof PersonType);      // true
console.log(person instanceof Object);      // true
```

In this code, `PersonType` is a constructor function that creates a single property called `name`. The `sayName()` method is assigned to the prototype so the same function is shared by all instances of `PersonType`. Then, a new instance of `PersonType` is created via the `new` operator, and the resulting `person` object is considered an instance of `PersonType` and of `Object` (through prototypal inheritance).

This same basic pattern underlies a lot of the class-mimicking JavaScript libraries. And that's where ECMAScript 6 classes start.

## Class Declarations

The simplest form of classes to understand is the one that looks similar to other languages: the class declaration. Class declarations begin with the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. The rest of the syntax looks similar to concise methods in object literals without requiring commas between them. For example, here's the class equivalent of the previous example:

```js
class PersonClass {

    // equivalent of the PersonType constructor
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // equivalent of PersonType.prototype.sayName
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
}

let person = new PersonClass("Nicholas");
person.sayName();   // outputs "Nicholas"

console.log(person instanceof PersonClass);     // true
console.log(person instanceof Object);          // true

console.log(typeof PersonClass);                    // "function"
console.log(typeof PersonClass.prototype.sayName);  // "function"
```

The class declaration `PersonClass` behaves quite similarly to `PersonType` from the previous example. Instead of defining a function as the constructor, class declarations allow you to define the constructor directly inside of the class using the special `constructor` method name. Since class methods use the concise syntax, there's no need to use the `function` keyword. All other method names have no special meaning, so you can add as many as you want.

I> Own properties, properties that occur on the instance rather than the prototype, can only be created inside of a class constructor or method. In the previous example, `name` is an own property. It's recommended to create all possible own properties inside of the constructor function so there's a single place that's responsible for all of them.

Perhaps the worst-kept secret in ECMAScript 6 is that class declarations such as this example are actually just syntactic sugar on top of the existing custom type declarations. The `PersonClass` declaration actually creates a function that has the behavior of the `constructor` method, which is why `typeof PersonClass` is `"function"`. Similarly, the `sayName()` method ends up as a method on `PersonClass.prototype`, similar to `PersonType.prototype` in the earlier example. These similarities allow you to mix custom types and classes without worry too much about which you're using.

Despite the similarities, there are some important differences to keep in mind:

1. Class declarations, unlike function declarations, are not hoisted. Class declarations act like `let` declarations and so exist in the temporal dead zone until execution reaches the declaration.
1. All code inside of class declarations runs in strict mode automatically. There's no way to opt-out of strict mode inside of classes.
1. All methods are non-enumerable. This is a significant change from custom types, where you need to use `Object.defineProperty()` to make a method non-enumerable.
1. Calling the class constructor without `new` throws an error.

With all of this in mind, the `PersonClass` declaration from the previous example is directly equivalent to the following:

```js
// direct equivalent of PersonClass
let PersonType2 = (function() {

    "use strict";

    function PersonType2(name) {

        // make sure the function was called with new
        if ((!this instanceof PersonType2)) {
            throw new Error("Constructor must be called with new.");
        }

        this.name = name;
    }

    Object.defineProperty(PersonType2.prototype, "sayName", {
        value: function() {
            console.log(this.name);
        },
        enumerable: false,
        writable: true,
        configurable: true
    });

    return PersonType2;
}());
```

While it was possible to do everything that classes do without adding new syntax, you can see how the class syntax makes all of the functionality a lot simpler than it would be otherwise.

## Class Expressions

Classes and functions are similar in that they have two forms: declarations and expressions. Function and class declarations begin with an appropriate keyword (`function` or `class`, respectively) followed by an identifier. Functions have an expression form that doesn't require an identifier after `function`, and similarly, classes have an expression form that doesn't require an identifier after `class`.

These *class expressions* are designed to be used in variable declarations or passed into functions as arguments. Here's the class expression equivalent of the previous examples:

```js
// class expressions do not require identifiers after "class"
let PersonClass = class {

    // equivalent of the PersonType constructor
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // equivalent of PersonType.prototype.sayName
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};

let person = new PersonClass("Nicholas");
person.sayName();   // outputs "Nicholas"

console.log(person instanceof PersonClass);     // true
console.log(person instanceof Object);          // true

console.log(typeof PersonClass);                    // "function"
console.log(typeof PersonClass.prototype.sayName);  // "function"
```

Aside from the syntax, class expressions are exactly equivalent to class declarations. This example omits the identifier after `class`, but you can also include it:

```js
let PersonClass = class PersonClass2 {

    // equivalent of the PersonType constructor
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // equivalent of PersonType.prototype.sayName
    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};

console.log(PersonClass === PersonClass2);  // true
```

In this case, `PersonClass` and `PersonClass2` both reference the same class, and so they can be used interchangeably.

Class expressions can also be used in some interesting ways. For example, they can be passed into functions as arguments:

```js
function createObject(classDef) {
    return new classDef();
}

let obj = createObject(class {

    sayHi() {
        console.log("Hi!");
    }
});

obj.sayHi();        // "Hi!"
```

In this example, an anonymous class expression is passed into `createObject()`. An instance is then created by using `new` and that object is returned.

Another interesting use of class expressions is to create singletons by immediately invoking the class constructor. To do so, you must use `new` with a class expression and include parentheses at the end. For example:

```js
let person = new class {

    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    sayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }

}("Nicholas");

person.sayName();       // "Nicholas"
```

Here, the anonymous class expression is created and then executed immediately. This pattern allows you to use the class syntax for creating singletons without leaving a class reference available for inspection. The parentheses at the end are the indicator that you're calling a function while also allowing you to pass in an argument.

Whether you use class declarations or class expressions is purely a matter of style. Unlike function declarations and function expressions, both class declarations and class expressions are not hoisted, and so the choice has little bearing on the runtime behavior of the code.

## Accessor Properties

While own properties should be created inside of class constructors, classes allow you to define accessor properties on the prototype by using a syntax similar to that of object literal accessor format. To create a getter, use the keyword `get` followed by a space followed by an identifier; to create a setter, do the same using the keyword `set`. For example:

```js
class CustomHTMLElement {

    constructor(element) {
        this.element = element;
    }

    get html() {
        return this.element.innerHTML;
    }

    set html(value) {
        this.element.innerHTML = value;
    }
}

var descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(CustomHTMLElement.prototype, "html");
console.log("get" in descriptor);   // true
console.log("set" in descriptor);   // true
console.log(descriptor.enumerable); // false
```

In this example, the `CustomHTMLElement` class is made as a simple wrapper around an existing DOM element. It has both a getter and setter for `html` that simply delegates to the `innerHTML` method on the element itself. This accessor property is created as non-enumerable, just like any other method would be, and is created on the `CustomHTMLElement.prototype`. The equivalent non-class representation is:

```
// direct equivalent to previous example
let CustomHTMLElement = (function() {

    "use strict";

    function CustomHTMLElement(element) {

        // make sure the function was called with new
        if ((!this instanceof CustomHTMLElement)) {
            throw new Error("Constructor must be called with new.");
        }

        this.element = element;
    }

    Object.defineProperty(CustomHTMLElement.prototype, "html", {
        enumerable: false,
        configurable: true,
        get: function() {
            return this.element.innerHTML;
        },
        set: function(value) {
            this.element.innerHTML = value;
        }
    });

    return CustomHTMLElement;
}());
```

As with previous examples, this one shows just how much code you're saving by using a class instead of the non-class equivalent. The accessor property definition alone is almost the size of the equivalent class declaration.
